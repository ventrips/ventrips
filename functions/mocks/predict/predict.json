While revenues grew for the fiscal year, they dropped 17% in Q4 to $263.6M; results were affected in part by a July 1, 2018, adoption of ASC Topic 606 for revenue recognition.    Excluding that impact, Q4 revenues would have been $326.2M (a 3% gain).    Operating loss swelled to $79.9M vs. a prior-year loss of $44.2M; adjusted operating loss increased to $34.9M vs. a year-ago loss of $1.3M.    Revenue by segment: MSG Entertainment, $174M (down 6%); MSG Sports, $90M (down 32%).    MSG Entertainment saw lower event-related revenues at venues and at the Boston Calling festival. In sports, the company was particularly hit by the impact of ASC 606, with  a heavy effect on ticket-related revenue, media rights fees from MSG Networks, suite license fees, league distributions and sponsorship/signage revenues.

The improvements in forward pricing and utilization are  leading indicators that the recovery is progressing, and we believe  benign environment floater fixtures made in 2018 marked the low point.\"The company also sees improving trends in the premium jack-up market, with marketed utilization  above 80% and rates trending towards $100K/day, and says \"while we are committed to  continuing our disciplined approach to jack-up reactivations, we believe  there are near term opportunities for some of our idle units.\""

                "description": "So just to be perfectly clear, I’m not remotely qualified to predict the future of US markets so I’m not going to even bother. I do think the 10% will definitely decrease though based on a very simple observation of inflation.  We have entered an age of much lower inflation, we don’t veer too far of the 2% mark these days. This is a good thing and actually better for investing in taxable accounts. Having a better control on inflation is also not bad for the markets so why will it return less than in the past. My simple reasoning that I believe is accepted as fact is that stocks do increase with inflation. They are companies, companies sell things, the prices of things they sell increase in price due to inflation. Most are aware of this and smart enough to think I need to subtract inflation from nominal gains to calculate what I’m really on track to have and what I’m going to need for $ in the future. So you take that 10% average and then subtract 2-3% inflation and arrive at the 7-8% in real gains.  The problem we are missing is the average 10% we use has a lot of gains from times when inflation was much higher but are subtracting today’s expected inflation. Due to the fact that inflation was higher back then the nominal gains also increased but their real gains were much lower.  So not a the maker will be weaker expectation, actually better in taxable account because you pay taxes of nominal gains so lower nominal gain and lower inflation is better than higher nominal gain and higher inflation due to tax purposes. The real issue is we have skewed expectations. Unfortunately I can not find average real gains through stock market history but something to consider if you are expecting 7-8%.",

Let's say I buy today with maturity on 9/3/19. Yields around 1.9% and the price would be somewhere around 99$. You invest 1000$ ...means 1 t-bill.  What will happen on maturity date?  From my understanding you get paid 1.9% yield on 1000$ on 9/3/19, right? Also you get your 1000$ back ..  So since this is the secondary market, does it matter that you maybe haven't bought the t-bill on auction day (but later) and will it still yield the % it showed on the day you purchased via your brokerage anyway?  Maybe someone can enlighten me on that topic ..many thanks!!",

LINK is joining that group - i.e. an honest project that couldn't live up to the hype.  RIP LINK",
