In his latest slap at the central bank, the president compared Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to a âgolfer who canât putt.â He also insisted the country is âdoing great with China and other Trade Dealsâ with âthe only problemâ being âJay Powell,â whom Trump appointed to the top position in February 2018.",

Iâm new to this but I think they operate somewhat like the Supreme Court where they are mostly immune to political and public opinion. I have a fear that could change but Iâm not sure if itâs valid. I think thereâs a very good chance if a recession come by election time Trump is really going to go all in and bring the Fed into the public spotlight. My worry is as we get more populist there will be a movement to subject the fed to elections or give the government direct control over it. It probably could be pretty popular too imo. The Fed is very important, presidents will blame them for everything wrong in the economy and the voters have the right to have a say who sits on the board. I think in that case itâs an absolute disaster, most of us are stupid and will vote for whoever is going to promise to juice the economy.. Throw in some lobbying and corruption and we have a real problem.  So my question is: whatâs the likelihood the fed could lose autonomy and if that happens how screwed are we having people run for a position few understand and running on messages that cater to average Americans that have no clue what the fed actually should do?",
